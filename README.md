# PowerBI_Dashboard_Sales
The project is based on the sales marketing . Here I have taken Madhav Ecommerce Sales Data , where the sales organization wants to track their online sales of the orders received. With the help of PowerBi Dashboard , tried to analyze it.
Here I have data in the form of 2 tables i.e. Orders table and Details table , where Orders table includes OrderID , OrderDate , State , CustomerName , City and Details table includes OrderID , Amount , Profit , Quantity , Category , Sub-Category , PaymentMode.
(Some values in the Profit column is negative which indicates loss of that particular order)
